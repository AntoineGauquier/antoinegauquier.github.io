I am teaching in the Introduction to Algorithms and Python programming courses in the <a href='https://psl.eu/formation/cpes-psl-louis-le-grand'>CPES « Data Science, Arts and Cultures »</a> program (joint program between the <a href='https://louislegrand.fr/'>Lycée Louis-le-Grand</a> and <a href='https://psl.eu/'>PSL University</a>), as well as in the Differential Calculus course in the <a href='https://psl.eu/formation/cpes-psl-henri-IV'>CPES « Sciences »</a> program (joint program between the <a href='https://lycee-henri4.com/'>Lycée Henri IV</a> and <a href='https://psl.eu/'>PSL University</a>).

<br>

I co-advised (with <a href='https://pierre.senellart.com/'>Pierre Senellart</a>) the interships of Léo Boullot and Paul Sevestre in 2024 (undergraduate students in the <a href='https://psl.eu/formation/cpes-psl-henri-IV'>CPES « Sciences »</a> program) on the automatic extraction and semantization of tables in PDF documents.

<br>

I am also doing service for science as an elected representative of non-permanent membres in the DIENS laboratory council, and for teaching as a membre of the selecting commitee of incoming students in the <a href='https://psl.eu/formation/cpes-psl-louis-le-grand'>CPES « Data Science, Arts and Cultures »</a> program.
