I am teaching in the <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> and <em>Python programming</em> courses in the <a href='https://psl.eu/formation/cpes-psl-louis-le-grand'>CPES « Data Science, Arts and Cultures »</a> program (joint program between <a href='https://louislegrand.fr/'>Lycée Louis-le-Grand</a> and <a href='https://psl.eu/'>PSL University</a>), as well as in the <em>Differential Calculus</em> course in the <a href='https://psl.eu/formation/cpes-psl-henri-IV'>CPES « Sciences »</a> program (joint program between <a href='https://lycee-henri4.com/'>Lycée Henri IV</a> and <a href='https://psl.eu/'>PSL University</a>).

I co-advised (with <a href='https://pierre.senellart.com/'>Pierre Senellart</a>) the internships of Léo Boullot and Paul Sevestre in 2024 (undergraduate students in the <a href='https://psl.eu/formation/cpes-psl-henri-IV'>CPES « Sciences »</a> program) on the automatic extraction and semantization of tables in PDF documents.

I am also an elected representative of non-permanent members in the <a href='https://www.di.ens.fr/'>DIENS laboratory</a> council, and a member of the selection commitee of incoming students in the <a href='https://psl.eu/formation/cpes-psl-louis-le-grand'>CPES « Data Science, Arts and Cultures »</a> program.
